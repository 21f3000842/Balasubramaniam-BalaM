# Balasubramaniam-BalaM

👋 Hi, I’m Balasubramaniam

I’m a student in the IIT Madras B.S. Degree Programme in Data Science, with a strong interest in machine learning and applied AI.

My core skill set includes Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and the broader ecosystem of libraries commonly used in machine learning workflows. I’ve worked on multiple ML projects, including:

A regression project using XGBoost

A deep learning project leveraging transformer architectures to perform emotion classification on text

In addition to machine learning, I have hands-on experience with full-stack development. I’m comfortable working with frontend technologies such as Vue.js and HTML, as well as backend development using SQLite. I’ve built two parking management applications, one implemented with Vue.js and one without it, focusing on core backend logic and system design.

I’m continuously learning and experimenting, and I enjoy building projects that combine data, algorithms, and real-world applications.
